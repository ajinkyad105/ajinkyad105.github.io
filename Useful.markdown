# This page will provide interesting and useful websites/cheatsheets


1. [Online electronic circuit simulator][elec_link]: Easily create analog and digital circuits, and check the results through simulations. Various [sample circuits](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/e-index.html) are given to quickly create required circuits and understand the circuit working in detail. I loved the visual representations for current flow.
