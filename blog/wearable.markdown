## What is Wearable Health Technology?
Wearable health monitoring devices, as the name suggests are the devices which are used to monitor the health status of a person. These devices are worn on the body for continous monitoring of the health status. This industry has grown tremendously over past 4 years. The devices are used not just by patients with medical risks, but also as fashion and health conscious people.

6. User friendly
7. Light weight
8. Capability to integrate with internet
9. Thoroughly tested
10. Low Cost
11. Data Security

## Case studies

1. **Tracking physiological indicators of Dementia related difficulties**: 
The important factor to track dimentia is agitation, which is casued by stress. Once agitation is detected, a trigger is generated to inform the caregiver which will help in reducing the detected agitation. There are many devices available in the market but each one has some challenges which requires more research to eliminate the risks. For example,
